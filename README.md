# Facebook-Notifications-Scraper

#### I don't like using Facebook, but it's unfortunately neccessary for social events, and organising managing the uni volleyball events. Therefore, I created this tool to go to my facebook notifications, scrape the most recent notifications, and based on criteria I specify, return the important notifications to me, without having to check Facebook manually.
